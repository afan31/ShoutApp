# ShoutApp
A ShoutApp built using Cassandra database.

Built a Cassandra database for an application called ShoutApp. This application is a simplified version of Twitter. Basically , I have users in this application who can follow each other and shout out (tweet) to each other.
I have used CQL (Cassandra Query Language) to construct the keyspace and the tables for the application .
The application is built using Express framework , and runs on Node.js server.
